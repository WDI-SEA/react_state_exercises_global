# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) ToDo List Exercise: State

Now we have a todo list! But.. it isn't changeable, and we can't just _think about_ eating hot cheetos and listening to Hot mulligan forever. At some point, we have to actually eat hot cheetos (delete it from the list) and find a moshpit buddy (adding that to the list). In other words, we need to be able to change the list!

Remember, in a React component, `state` is just another object, like `props`. The only difference is that `state` can be changed (remember, though, to always change it through the method `setState`). The exception is setting the initial state, which is only done once (either in the instructor or a standalone `state` object). In order to pass items to the `MyList` component and make them mutable, we'll need to set the state of our `MyList`. Let's continue refactoring our `MyList` component to change the `todoItems` array through state.

## Clearing the items
We're going to add a button to the list that allows users to clear away
everything in it. 

### Set up state:

First, let's convert the list to be a state attribute, that way we can change it using `setState` later!

* At the top of the `MyList` component, set an initial state for an attribute called `taskList`. It should be equal to the initial list that's passed in as a prop from `index.js`.
* Don't forget to change the `map` call!
* Always check to be sure your website is accurate (it should still look the same).

```js
import ListItem from './ListItem'

class MyList extends Component {

  state = {
    taskArray: this.props.theList
  }
  
  render() {
    
    let todoItems = this.state.taskArray.map((item, index) => {
      return <ListItem task={item} key={index} />
    })

    return(<div>
      <h1>Things I should stop procrastinating:</h1>
      <ul>
        {todoItems}
      </ul>
    </div>)
  }
}

export default MyList
```

### Add a clearList helper method

Now, we'll look into making this list changeable. Remember, updating state will involve calling `setState`. Let's use a simple example with a "clear" button in `MyList`.

First, in `MyList`, we define the function that will be called by the button:

```js
clearList = () => {
  this.setState({
      taskArray: []
    })
}
```

Then, add a button after the whole `<ul>` list.

**MyList.js**
```html
<ul>
  ...
</ul>
<button onClick={(e) => this.clearList(e)}>Finished the list!</button>
```

This makes our `MyList` component look like this:

**MyList.js**
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import './App.css'
import ListItem from './ListItem'

class MyList extends Component {

  state = {
    taskArray: this.props.theList
  }

  clearList = () => {
    console.log("clearing list")
    this.setState({
      taskArray: []
    })
  }

  render() {

    let todoItems = this.state.taskArray.map((item, index) => {
      return <ListItem task={item} key={`todo${index}`} />
    })

    return(<div>
      <h1>Things I should stop procrastinating:</h1>
      <ul>
        {todoItems}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={this.clearList}>Clear List</button>
    </div>)
  }
}

export default MyList

```

> Don't forget to try it out!

Now when we click on the button, the following will occur:
* `this.setState` will set the state, `taskArray`, to be empty: `{taskArray: []}`
* The render function for `MyList` will be called and re-render the component.
* We'll feel good about ourselves for going to the gym, even if we ate ice cream first.


 ### Sure-fire Coding
 There's lots of things that can go wrong when we try to hook up
 new functionality to our app. Our button might be set up wrong, it might not
 call the correct function, the function may have an error in it.

 Let's add a `console.log()` statement on the first line in our `clearList`
 function. This is an excellent debugging practice. Adding `console.log()` proves
 to us that the function is actually executing. This proves to us that there's
 nothing wrong with how we hooked up the button and helps narrow our focus in
 case something else went wrong.

 Let's say you click the button and the list isn't cleared.
 * If you didn't see `"Clearing list!"` in the console then you know something is
   wrong with the way you hooked up the button. Investigate that.
 * If you did see `"Clearing List!"` in the console and the list still didn't
   clear then you know you need to investigate your code inside the function
   after the click.

 Adding simple sanity checks like this to your code will make you a productive
 programmer.

 ```js
  clearList = () => {
    console.log("clearing list")
    this.setState({
      taskArray: []
    })
  }
 ```

## Adding items

Let's add one more thing to our app: an input field for more items. In order to do so, we'll need a variable to represent the new item we'll be entering.

* Create a variable `newItem` in the state to hold the new item that the user inputs.

> Make a new state attribute, initializing `newItem` to a blank string. (Hint: remember, `state` is just a JavaScript object, so you you need a comma between key-value pairs.)

We'll also need two additional functions to represent the following changes in state:

* `newItemChange`, for when we type characters into an input field and change the value of `newItem`  
 * We'll need to get the current value of the input field and set state accordingly.
 > Create this function with an event parameter of 'e'. Inside the function, change the state of `newItem` to `e.target.value` - this will be the value the user entered into the form.

* `addItem`, for when we submit the form
 * We'll need to make a copy of `taskArray`, push the `newItem`, set `state` and finally clear `newItem`.
 > Create this function with an event parameter of 'e'. Inside the function, create a new variable initialized to the value of the array that is saved in state. Then, use `yourArray.push(<value>)` to push the new item from the state into the array. Set the `newItem` state back to an empty string, and set the `toDoItemArray` state to your new array.


Lastly, we'll need to add a form to our `render` method.

```js
<form>
  <input type="text"
   placeholder="Type an item here"
   onChange={(e) => this.newItemChange(e)}
   value={this.state.newItem}
  />
  <button onClick={(e) => this.addItem(e)}>Add it!</button>
</form>
```

Notes:
 * We can use `onChange` on the `input` field to trigger an event when the text in the box is changed.  
 * Any function called when an event occurs (like functions that happen `onClick`, `onSubmit`, or `onChange`) can accept an argument that is the event. We pass this in as `e` to `newItemChange` and `addItem`.

## Debugging Adding Items
If you click "Add it!" and the page doesn't change, and you think you've done
everything right there's one thing you're probably missing. Here's a good
debugging strategy to figure out what's wrong.

Add a `console.log` statement inside your `addItem` function to make sure the
function is actually being executed. If you don't see simple output in your
console then there's something wrong with how you hooked up the button to the
`addItem` function. You need to investigate how the button is attached to the
function.

If you click the button and an empty item appears in your list then you need
to investigate how you're retrieving the text value out of the form input.
Use a console statement to print the value of the text to make sure you're
accessing it correctly.

If you see a simple console statement working, and you see the correct text
being printed and you still don't see items added to the list correctly then
there's one last hiccup that causes lots of problems: the button is inside a
form and it triggers a `submit` event. Submit events make the page reload, or
(more accurately) navigate to the url `action` attribute of the form. If there's
no `action` attribute defined the page just navigates to itself, and reloads.

Make sure your `addItem` function accepts an `e` event parameter and calls
.preventDefault to stop the submit event from firing.

```js
addItem(e) {
  // prevent the event from running the default "submit" event.
  e.preventDefault()

  // then the rest of your code.
  // ...
}
```

# Final Code

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import './App.css'
import ListItem from './ListItem'

class MyList extends Component {

  state = {
    taskArray: this.props.theList,
    newItem: ''
  }

  clearList = () => {
    console.log("clearing list")
    this.setState({
      taskArray: []
    })
  }

  newItemChange = (e) =>{
    this.setState({newItem: e.target.value})
  }

  addItem = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    let tempTaskArray = this.state.taskArray
    tempTaskArray.push(this.state.newItem)
    this.setState({
      taskArray: tempTaskArray,
      newItem: ''
    })
  }

  render() {

    let todoItems = this.state.taskArray.map((item, index) => {
      return <ListItem task={item} key={`todo${index}`} />
    })

    return(<div>
      <h1>Things I should stop procrastinating:</h1>
      <form>
        <input 
          type="text" 
          placeholder="type an item here"
          onChange={(e)=>this.newItemChange(e)}
          value={this.state.newItem}
        />
        <button onClick={(e)=>this.addItem(e)}>Add It!</button>
      </form>
      <ul>
        {todoItems}
      </ul>
      <button onClick={this.clearList}>Clear List</button>
    </div>)
  }
}

export default MyList
```
